## Insertion of elevation data

Implementation of the last task in the DAG:

**Process Elevations** (`process_elevations_task`):
   - Connects to MongoDB and retrieves all walking trail documents
   - For each coordinate in the trail segments:
     - Finds the appropriate SRTM tile based on lat/lon
     - Extracts elevation data using rasterio
     - Updates MongoDB document with elevation data
   - Adds elevation data directly to coordinate objects: `{"lat": X, "lon": Y, "elevation": Z}`
   - Updates document timestamp when modifications are made
   - Includes verification steps to confirm successful updates

The problem is that the execution is very slow. To be improved.
