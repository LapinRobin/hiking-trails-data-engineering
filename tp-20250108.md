## Elevation API
With the implemented path finding algorithm, the weights of certain way points can be adjusted depending on user preference. One example in including elevation using the coordinates pulled. However, there were many problems faced. 

For instance:

1. **Lack of suitable APIs**
   - Google's Elevation API has a billing plan incompatible with our project
   - The few elevation APIs did not work or required high amounts of storage of TIFF (raster files) of the world, bogging down weight of the program

2. **API constraints**
   - Found Open Meteo, a Azure sponsored free API platform for weather data
   - Only 10,000 API calls could be made per day, with a maximum of 100 coordinates within one API call
   - Given that within one bounding box of 4km^2 (45째44'26.0"N 4째49'45.0"E, 45째45'58.2"N 4째53'35.0"E), there already exists 14,683 ways. One way can have multiple coordinates if it is a path. Given a densely connected map, and a way had on average 7 coordinates, a 4km by 4km area would have 102,781 coordinate points (which also means 102,781 elevation values), meaning we can only generate a maximum of less than 10 queries per day. 
   - In order to circumvent this, I intend to calculate only the elevation of the start and end points of each way, which reduces costly API calls at the expense of smoother gradients and potentially being unable to detect undulating terrain. 

## Writing elevation back into MongoDB
Currently, elevation data is written for only start and end points. This achieves the minimum goal of finding net elevation increase/decrease.
