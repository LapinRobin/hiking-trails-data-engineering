## Integrating elevation dag into main walking trail dag


## Enriching data with distance

I created a new dag called distance.py. This dag will calculate the distance of each segment of the walking trail(relation) and the total distance of the trail. The distance is calculated using the coordinates of the points in and is displayed in kilometers.

## Enriching data with elevation profile

I created a new dag called profile.py. This dag will calculate the total ascending and descending elevations for all trails in MongoDB documents.
