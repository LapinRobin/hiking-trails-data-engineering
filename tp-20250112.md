## Integrating elevation dag into main walking trail dag


## Enriching data with distance and difficulty

I created a new dag called distance.py. This dag will calculate the distance of each segment of the walking trail(relation) and the total distance of the trail. The distance is calculated using the coordinates of the points in and is displayed in kilometers.
