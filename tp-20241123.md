## Downloading data from OSM
As for now, we have figured out the query to get data from api calls in overpass turbo:

```
[out:json][timeout:25];
(
// Define the bounding box coordinates: (min_lat, min_long, max_lat, max_long)
  // Select relations that are routes or superroutes for foot, walking, or hiking
  relation["type"~"route|superroute"]["route"~"foot|walking|hiking"](45.639918,4.610171,45.845015,5.129275);
);
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```

There are two options for data formats: json and xml.
For our use case, json would be a better choice for several reasons:

1. **Data Structure & Readability**
   - Clean, hierarchical structure that's easy to read and parse
   - More concise than XML's verbose tag structure
   - Human-readable format

2. **Programming Benefits**
   - Native support in Python and most modern languages
   - Excellent library ecosystem (pandas, numpy etc.)
   - Lightweight and fast processing
   - Easy integration with MongoDB and other databases

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Simple to validate and debug
   - Great tooling support
   - Straightforward data transformations

## Convert osm data to geojson

After some careful looks, I found out with dissappointment that the OSM query only returns json or raw osm data (xml).

json file doesn't contain any geometry data, so we need to convert the xml to geojson.

In order to convert xml to geojson we use the osmtogeojson library in npm. Not to say that npm is the best tool for the job, but it works.

I wrote a custom python script called `osm2geojson.py` to optimize the workflow.

As for now, the airflow dag is usable, with just one xml download and one geojson file creation.

Todo:
- For large areas, use sliding window technique to download data
- Add mongo db operator to the dag
- Delete duplicate data
