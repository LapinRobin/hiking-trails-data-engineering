## Data ingestion from OSM API

After some research we noticed that our queries don't quite fit the objectives that we sought for. 
Instead, we will try to change the request in the API call and get the correct data and structure from the OSM API. 

After looking at the GeoJSON file and the XML file, we also noticed that there were some problems in converting XML to GeoJSON. 

Some important changes.

- Changed way to relation:       
    `way ["highway"~"^(path|track|footway|steps|bridleway)$"]` to
    `relation["type"~"route|superroute"]["route"~"foot|walking|hiking"]`

- Changed the osm to geo json script so that the data is structured as relations containing individual ways which eventually contain separate nodes.

## Data ingestion from raster data

In order to avoid the issue with rate limits from API calls, we decided to use raster data, which is in tiff format.

We used the SRTM data from the [USGS](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), which is a free and open source dataset.

### Elevation DAG Tasks

The elevation data pipeline consists of the following tasks:

1. **Download SRTM Files** (`download_srtm_files`):
   - Downloads SRTM zip files from the CGIAR website
   - Targets 6 specific tiles covering our area of interest (36_03, 36_04, 37_03, 37_04, 38_03, 38_04)
   - Creates a zip directory and stores downloaded files
   - Skips already downloaded files to prevent redundant downloads

2. **Unzip SRTM Files** (`unzip_srtm_files`):
   - Extracts the downloaded zip files into temporary directories
   - Creates separate temporary directories for each SRTM tile
   - Handles potential corrupted zip files with error reporting
   - Passes the extracted directory paths to the next task

3. **Move TIF Files** (`move_tif_files`):
   - Moves the extracted TIF files to a final destination directory
   - Renames files to maintain consistent naming convention
   - Cleans up temporary extraction directories
   - Provides final paths of the processed TIF files

The pipeline follows a sequential execution: download → unzip → move files, ensuring proper data handling at each step.
