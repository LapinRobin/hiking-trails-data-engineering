After some research we noticed that our queries don't quite fit the objectives that we sought for. 
Instead, we will try to change the request in the API call and get the correct data and structure from the OSM API. 

After looking at the GeoJSON file and the XML file, we also noticed that there were some problems in converting XML to GeoJSON. 

Some important changes.

- Changed way to relation:       
    `way ["highway"~"^(path|track|footway|steps|bridleway)$"]` to
    `relation["type"~"route|superroute"]["route"~"foot|walking|hiking"]`

- Changed the osm to geo json script so that the data is structured as relations containing individual ways which eventually contain separate nodes.
