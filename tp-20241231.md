## A* (star) Path Finding Algorithm
Since we need a start and end to our trail, there must be an implementation of a trail suggestion algorithm. 

Easier options such as using pre-existing APIs to create a "best" path via coordinates were too trivial, and were not specific enough for our user profile and use cases. 

There are two options for path finding algorithms: A* and Dijsktra. For our use case, A* would be a better choice for several reasons:

1. **Increased effciency**
   - Dijkstra solves the best path slower than A*
   - A* uses Euclidean distance to create a "direction" towards the end point
   - Dijsktra also needs to relax far more nodes than A*

2. **Context Suitability**
   - Given that we are working in a coordinate system, we can easily compute euclidean distances
   - Use of haversine function to compute spherical distance.

## Flattening of MongoDB
The geojson file faced multiple layers of nesting, making querying, updating and inserting any new values confusing. Hence, the aggregate function was used to bring the coordinates higher up in the nesting, and alongside waypoint characteristics.
